# Layout Examples

This folder contains a series of CSS layout examples.

For simple copy-pasting, the code of each example is included in the HTML file.

Some commonly used elements:

- **CSS / normalize.min.css** : [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), a CSS reset stylesheet.
- **CSS / main.css** : Contains some basic settings. Applies **box sizing: border-box** to all page elements (see [documentation](http://cours-web.ch/css/box-model)).
- **JS / prefixfree.min.js** : This script [by Lea Verou](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) will add all needed browser prefixes to your CSS, so you don't have to write them. This keeps your CSS code clean and maintainable.
